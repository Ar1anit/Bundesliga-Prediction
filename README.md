# üèÜ Bundesliga Prediction Project

## üìã Overview
The Bundesliga Prediction project is an innovative application designed to predict the outcomes of Bundesliga football matches. This project leverages machine learning techniques and web scraping to analyze match data and provide insightful predictions.

## üåü Features
- **Data Scraping**: Utilizes a custom-built scraper to gather match data from the Bundesliga website.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Employs a sophisticated machine learning model to analyze match data and predict outcomes.
- **Interactive Frontend**: Features a user-friendly interface built with React, allowing users to interact with the predictions and data.

## üíª Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Django for the server-side logic.
- **Frontend**: React for building a dynamic user interface.
- **Machine Learning**: Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for data processing and model building.
- **Data Storage**: CSV files for storing and processing match data.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Django backend server.
4. Start the React frontend application.

## üìä Usage
- **Data Scraping**: Run the scraper to collect the latest match data.
- **Model Training**: Train the machine learning model with the collected data.
- **Predictions**: Access the predictions through the React frontend.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
